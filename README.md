## About the Project 



The idea of the application is pretty simple - we make a call to an API, which then responds with the daily news.


I used the tools for the Project 

Consistency with Design:
Double-check all visual elements against the Figma design.
Ensure spacing, font sizes, colors, and alignments are consistent.

Responsiveness:
Test the layout on various screen sizes and devices to ensure it looks good on all of them.
Use Chrome DevTools to simulate different devices.

Semantic HTML:
I made sure verify Semantic HTML before I send to code Reviewer.


Functionality:
Verify that all interactive elements (buttons, links, forms) work as intended.
Test user authentication (sign-in, sign-out) thoroughly.

Error Handling:
Ensure there are no console errors or warnings.
Handle network errors gracefully and provide user feedback.


Code Quality:
Run a code linting tool to check for any code quality issues.
Ensure your code follows best practices and is well-documented.








Also This is Frontend Application but doesn't run with Backend.



Sorry, API Requests are out And You can run my Application via VS CODE
